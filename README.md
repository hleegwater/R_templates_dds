# Making a package to get an Rmd template

Hanneke Leegwater. June 2022

First, I created a package using the instructions on <https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/rmd-templates.html> part 12.

Then, I followed the instructions on <https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/rmd-templates.html> to create a template that I like.

## Install template for the first time

-   Clone repository
-   Open Rproj project
-   Click on Build, next to the Environment, History etc
-   Install
-   Restart Rstudio

## Edit a template

-   Templates can be found in skeleton folders and skeleton files within inst/rmarkdown/templates
-   Each template has its own folder
-   Edit the skeleton file, don't forget to check if the yaml file is still okay!

## Instructions on how to build the template after changing the skeleton

1.  Save everything,
2.  Click on Build, next to the Environment, History etc
3.  Install
4.  Restart Rstudio
5.  Don't forget to commit the changes and push to the remote repository if needed!
